        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>
          This project explores the intersection between code and visual art
          through the manipulation of images using pixel sorting algorithms.
          <strong>Relative Perspectives</strong> uses JavaScript to create
          interactive images that respond to user input, sorting columns of
          pixels based on their perceived luminance. This fluidity exposes the
          fragility of the digital image, serving as a metaphor for how easily
          individuals in society can be manipulated. It suggests that our
          perceived stability is not secure, and is just waiting for an external
          force to reorder our reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this project is to highlight how the perspective of an
          object can either change drastically or remain relatively consistent
          depending on its internal structure. This acts as an allegory for
          digital governance: the algorithm used here is mathematically
          unbiased, treating every pixel with the exact same logic. Yet, the
          results of this non-bias still produce dramatically different effects.
          It demonstrates that applying a neutral rule to an unequal society
          doesn't remove inequality. Instead, the initial conditions of the
          subject determine the final path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across this collection of twelve images, you will see varying degrees
          of entropy. Some images possess a structure that results in very
          little change, appearing basically the same, while others flip into
          mirrored perspectives or dissolve into complex, chaotic abstractions.
          This visualizes the flaw in trying to strip bias from our
          computational models such as machine learning algorithms. If bias is a
          reflection of our real world, removing it often means introducing
          artificial data, and keeping the biased model would be the most
          accurate representation of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, this work questions why we try so hard to make technology
          neutral when neutrality does not actually make things fair. Even if an
          algorithm treats everyone exactly the same, the inherent inequalities
          in the starting data guarantees that the results will still be
          unequal.
