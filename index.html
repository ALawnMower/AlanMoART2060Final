        <p>
          This artwork, "Digital Erosion," uses code to look at ideas of order,
          decay, and rebuilding. The four pictures each show a single, still
          moment. When you move your mouse over a picture, a sorting algorithm
          starts to run. This code rearranges the pixels in each column, sorting
          them by the luminance. This creates an effect that looks like the
          "erosion" of a landscape or the layers you'd see in rock. The code is
          forcing a new, strict order on the original photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The images chosen were specifically selected to have very straight and
          geometric lines, so that you are able to see the result of sorting the
          columns based on luminance.
